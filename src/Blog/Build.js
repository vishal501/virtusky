    <h3>What does it depend upon?</h3>   
    <p class="build-txt">Generally a few factors need to be taken into consideration before determining how long will it take to create a website. A website with fewer pages and features will take a shorter span than a heavy multifunctional website. Let us discuss a few factors that affect website development:<br/>
    Site map: The number of pages a website needs determines the time it'll take to develop it.<br/>
    Features and integration: How complex are the features and integrations?<br/>
    Design requirements: Brand guidelines come in handy while designing a website.<br/>
    Content: You know your brand the best. What kind of content you need on your website also determines the time taken to design it.

    What is the development process?
    </h3>
    <p class="build-txt">
    Usually, it takes 10-12 weeks to deliver a website. Meanwhile, you do not want to be wondering about what goes on behind closed doors. We will give you a clear action plan with proper breakdowns.<br/>
    In the first week, the developers build a solid understanding of your brand so that you and they are on the same page.<br/>
    Week 2 is spent on understanding the users and their experience of your brand. Your designer would want to understand what others' expectations of your brand are.<br/>
    Weeks 3 and 4 are spent on designing the proper User Interface. An engaging and interactive UI design is important to get your point through to your consumers.<br/>
    Weeks 5-10 are the days spent on the development process. After the design, comes coding. Your developers provide you a beta link once everything is ready.<br/>
    Weeks 11 and 12 are for Testing so that they ensure a bug-free and secure platform for your brand. Here, you are given the required time to finalize content and other details.<br/>
    At the end of week 12, they are ready to launch your dream website.
