    <br/><br/><br/><p class="cloud-txt">A complete website redesign implies changing things from the ground up and beginning with the code all over again. Let us focus on the pros of getting a website revamped:</p>
    <ol>
    <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Improved branding: A consistent brand will keep its consistency when it comes to the website revamp. By undergoing a complete makeover, your website will build trust with your consumers and gain brand recognition and popularity. New is getting old as seconds tick, and nowadays users have a very short attention span. You do not want to be missing out on revenue just because you fail to provide something new for your users to look at. The overall design and construction of your website are used to evaluate your brand's trustworthiness by your consumers. A good user experience offers a good first impression and goes a long way while building lasting client-consumer relationships.
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
            <span>Improved Search engine rankings: Having a well-designed website means better Search Engine Optimization. As your rank increases on the search engine results, your brand's credibility increases. You stay one step ahead of your competitors. This gets you more organic traffic and hence, increases your conversion rate. Moreover, as more and more people visit your website and see that it is modern and sophisticated, they will tend to build long-lasting relations with your brand. And did we mention? A well-designed website also attracts more backlinks, giving you a push for higher Google rankings.
            </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Better information flow: As you get your website revamped, it reaches out to more consumers. This leads to better awareness of your brand. As potential customers learn about you through your website, you close more deals and get more revenue. An interactive website provides information about your brand, availability, and business. This persuades people to trust in your brand and become paying customers.
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>More traffic and sales: A website redesign leads to more traffic coming your way, which will ultimately boost your conversion rate and sales. In a fast-changing world, it pays to evaluate what your brand and website need and act on that information. You must understand what drives your target audience to make that purchase and accordingly optimize your website. You can redesign your website in a way that makes conversion your primary focus so that your sole aim is to make more sales.
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Increasing revenue, cutting costs: A website revamp improves brand consistency and boosts your ranking on the Google search results, thereby increasing your revenue. Last but not the least, you also get the opportunity to reevaluate your Content Management System. A new website runs more smoothly and efficiently, thereby reducing hassle and costs. This also increases speed and provides a better and safer platform for you to function. Redesigning a website is easier on your pockets than adding more features or fixing functionality.
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Responsiveness: An outdated website would not be responsive to all platforms, including mobile phones. Many users in India operate a cellphone rather than a laptop or tablet. This reduces your reach to the users. A mobile-friendly site is the basic need of a business. Apart from that, by redesigning a website, you get to improve your site’s speed and make it hassle-free for your customers. We know that users hate to wait!
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Fix issues with user experience: Your site’s UX should be your primary concern. Chances are that if your website is outdated, its UX has run out of its form. User Experience ultimately affects Customer Experience. So you do not want to be leaving a chance to optimize either. A vintage look is not appreciated by potential clients and raises questions about your credibility. If you know that they are going to make assumptions based on your design, you must capitalize on that opportunity by giving your site a revamp.
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Rapidly changing industry: With the pandemic, the industries, as well as your audience, have undergone a huge change. Trends and shifts in customer behavior are common in today’s time and world. People who used to find something appealing are now finding that very thing outdated. You do not want to be left behind in a world that continuously moves forward. That is why we recommend a site revamp for your brand.
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Easing complexities: A convoluted site structure is a signal for you to get a website revamped. Users must always find your website easy to navigate. However, outdated websites are often a hassle when navigating, and this ends up giving a bad impression of your brand. This leads to poor SEO performance, and you might see a drop in organic traffic. Do we need to repeat the need for a website revamp?
        </span></li>
        <li class="cloudlist">
        <span>Adding new features: If your brand has achieved success or gone through some major shifts in the market successfully, chances are that you are looking for more. It might even be the case that the purpose or meaning of your brand has changed. To reflect these changes, you will need to add new functionality and features to your website. Whether it is utilizing eCommerce or a need for a complex technical integration, your website will need a new set of hands to mold it into your vision. Let those hands be ours.
